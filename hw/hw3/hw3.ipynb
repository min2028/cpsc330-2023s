A side advantage of this would be that with a bigger test split, we'll have a more reliable estimate of the model performance!_"

    "| Feature | Transformation | Explanation\n",
    "| --- | ----------- | ----- |\n",
    "| age | scaling |  A numeric feature with no missing values. Good idea to apply scaling, as the range of values (17 to 90) is quite different compared to other numeric features.|\n",
    "| workclass | imputation, one-hot encoding |  Some values are missing so imputation will be needed. The workclass's unique values have no ordinality. For instance, there is private and state-gov is no more different than private and self-emp-inc. |\n",
    "| fnlwgt | drop | This is the number of people the census believes the entry represents. This information is irrelevant as it should not impact the target value. | \n",
    "| education | ordinal encoding | Ordinal encoding preserves the ordinal relationship between the education levels. For instance, HS-grad and bachelors or closer to each other than HS-grad and doctorate. | \n",
    "| education.num | drop | The education.num is highly correlated to education and seems to show the number of educational years which can generally be predicted by the education. |\n",
    "| marital.status | one-hot encoding  | Marital status has no ordinal relationship between each other. The marital status should be viewed independently of each other. |\n",
    "| occupation | imputation, one-hot encoding  | There are missing values so imputation is necessary and there are different occupations that have no ordinal relationship between each other. |\n",
    "| relationship | one-hot encoding  | Similar to marital status, there are no ordinal relationship between the values and should be viewed independently. |\n",
    "| race | drop  | This feature may not provide reliable information to predict the target variable. |\n",
    "| sex | one-hot encoding with \"binary=True\" | Sex in the dataset can be represented in binary without having extra column. 1 would represent male and 0 would represent female or vice versa. There are no ordinal relationships between them. |\n",
    "| capital.gain | scaling | Scaling would be a good way to ensure that the values of this feature is not dominant over other features as the range of values is pretty wide (0 to 99999) | \n",
    "| capital.loss | scaling | Scaling would be a good way to ensure that the values of this feature is not dominant over other features as the range of values is pretty wide (0 to 4356) |\n",
    "| hours.per.week | scaling | Scaling would be a good way to ensure that the values of this feature is not dominant over other features as the range of values is pretty wide (1 to 99) |\n",
    "| native.country | imputation, one-hot encoding | There is a set number of countries and they can be thought of independently with no ordinality between the values. | \n",
